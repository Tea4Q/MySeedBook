- [x ] Verify `app.json` configuration for production
- [x ] Check `eas.json` build profiles
- [x ] Confirm environment variables are properly set
- [x ] Validate deep linking configuration
- [ ] Test offline functionality

## 📱 Platform Testing

- [ ] iOS testing on physical device
- [x ] Android testing on physical device (confirmed tablet/phone orientation working)
- [x ] Web platform testing
- [ ] Cross-platform image upload functionality
- [ ] Calendar RLS policies working across platforms

## 🎨 User Experience

- [x] Responsive design working (tablet/phone layouts)
- [x] Image handling for seed suppliers (RareSeeds, Burpee)
- [x] Calendar events displaying correctly
- [ ] Loading states and error messages user-friendly

## 🎯 Current Status

**Ready for Production Testing**: The app has completed security cleanup and core functionality validation. All critical authentication bypasses have been removed, debug logging cleaned up, and major features (responsive design, calendar, image handling) are working.

**Next Steps**: 
1. Configure production Supabase environment
2. Final platform testing on physical devices
3. Set up monitoring and analytics
4. Deploy to staging environment for final validation
