# Login Navigation Fix

## Issue
After successful login, the authentication screen did not disappear and navigate to the main application on mobile devices.

## Root Cause
The mobile navigation logic in `app/_layout.tsx` had a "no-op" behavior when users became authenticated, meaning it would stay on the current screen (auth screen) instead of navigating to the main app.

```tsx
// Previous problematic code:
if (isAuthenticated) {
  // No-op: Let mobile navigation stay where it is
} else {
  router.replace('/auth');
}
```

This logic only handled redirecting **to** the auth screen when not authenticated, but failed to redirect **away from** the auth screen when authentication succeeded.

## Solution
Updated the mobile navigation logic to actively navigate to the main application (`/(tabs)`) when the user becomes authenticated:

```tsx
// Fixed code:
if (isAuthenticated) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    SplashScreen.hideAsync();
    router.replace('/(tabs)');
  }, 500);
} else {
  router.replace('/auth');
}
```

## Files Modified
- `app/_layout.tsx` - Fixed mobile navigation logic to redirect authenticated users to main app
- `lib/auth.tsx` - Removed debug logging (cleanup)

## Testing
✅ Login now properly navigates from auth screen to main app on mobile  
✅ Logout properly navigates from main app back to auth screen  
✅ Authentication state changes are handled correctly  
✅ Web platform navigation remains unaffected  

## Technical Details
The authentication flow works as follows:
1. User enters credentials on auth screen
2. `signIn()` function is called in AuthProvider
3. Supabase fires `SIGNED_IN` auth state change event
4. AuthProvider updates `session` and `user` state
5. `_layout.tsx` detects `isAuthenticated` change via `useEffect`
6. Navigation logic calls `router.replace('/(tabs)')` to go to main app
7. Auth screen disappears and user sees main application

This fix ensures proper navigation flow while maintaining the existing splash screen timing and web platform compatibility.
